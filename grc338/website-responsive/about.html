             <h2>All we think about is Pizza</h2>
            <p>We have always loved food and how it brings people together.  The sharing of a table and a meal is wonderfully complemented by an exchange of thoughts and ideas.  And this food that we share is so important.  Where it comes from, how it was grown or treated, and how it was procured all has a lasting impact on our health and the wellbeing of the Earth.  We care about the food that we eat and the food that we serve.  We source our ingredients from local farms and purveyors who support an organic and sustainable future for our Earth.</p>
