        <h3>Sunday Album Audit</h3>
            <p>For this project, I was commissioned by a talent agency to entirely conceptualize and create a logo for their music blog, a new sector of their business. Through this project, I worked closely with my client to gather information on what they were looking to portray with their new logo. Through careful consideration, I was able to come up with a few different concepts that my client could choose from. Once they chose the half-record logo, I was able to apply necessary tweaks and edits as my client saw fit. </p>

          <h3>Graduation Announcements</h3>
         <p>Upon ordering graduation announcements to send to my family and friends, I realized that I had the software to be able to make my own at a fraction of the price. Once I finished making my own, I was able to make some for my friends as well! Here is an example of one that I made for my friend, Alexis. </p>
